# Computer Vision RPS
This project contains a way to play rock-paper-scissor with the computer using the computer's camera to indicate user's choice. It leverages image model from [teachable-machine]([url](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)), wherein the image model is trained using images for different actions. You can find the image model (keras_model.h5) and text file (labels.txt) in the GitHub folders
